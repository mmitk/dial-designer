# Dial Designer

Collection of scripts and functionalities created to help me in my specific quest in designing watch dials. Specifically:

- Layering images according to coloring/location
- Stacking layered images
- Applying transparency to layers on a gradient
- Apply background image against transparent sections

Future use cases to be covered:
- Basic UI use case
- Detect dial markings and ignore in layering process
- Increase and maintain high resolution
- Vectorize images
- Export vectorized images
- Print setup/ image resizing
